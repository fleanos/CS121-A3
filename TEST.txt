Queries 1-10 cover common topics in computer science and should perform well in terms of ranking and runtime performance. 
Queries 11-15 were not performing well due to the nature of the search covering more complex topics that had less textual content.
Queries 16-20 covered more specialized topics and that didn't not perform as well due to limited content available in the index.

Queries 11 - 20 were signfcantly improved from milestone 2 to milestone 3 due to the implementation of TF-IDF within our search engine taking
into account that rarity of a term plays a large part in its ranking. Furthermore also taking into account presence of important words helped the
terms due to our ranking algoritm providing a 25% boost to the importance of words that appear in the page title, headings, bold or strong within documents.
In addition ranking scores are comparable across documents of different lengths, being the reason the ranking algorithm also normalizes the scores  adjusting for 
differences in document lengths, and ensures that documents with higher raw scores are not given undue weightage simply because they are longer.
